# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will expand EduGenius to include Chemistry as a third subject area alongside Mathematics and Physics. The chemistry section will provide interactive learning modules covering fundamental to advanced chemistry concepts, maintaining consistency with the existing educational structure while introducing chemistry-specific features like molecular visualization, chemical equation balancing, and reaction mechanisms.
